## About MeðŸ‘‹
Hey there ðŸ˜„! My name is Filipe, I'm a Mechanical Engineer, specialised in CAD and mechanical design, with a hidden passion for programming and automation, born and raised in sunny Portugal. I have taken an interest for programming early on in my life, and have delved more recently into Data Science adn Machine Learning, since I find fascinating the predictive capability associated with statistics and its almost limitless potential. Although I did not pursue superior education related to it, I am always trying to learn new ways to automate and simplify my day to day.

Please feel free to check my [Portfolio on GitHub](https://github.com/FilipeLMF4/portfolio), where you can find most of my programming projects (developed for courses and personal uses). Currently I'm more proficient with Python, although I also know some VBScript, VBA, SQL and HTML.

I also have a [website](https://filipelmf4.wixsite.com/filipe-ferreira)! There I showcase my resume and project portfolio of my professional and academic experience. Check it out!

If you find anything interesting and want to know more, or simply want to connect, feel free to send me an [email](mailto:filipelmf4@gmail.com) or reach out through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filipe-ferreira-2baab5123/) ðŸ˜‰.
